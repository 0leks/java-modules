    // 1. Create a Stack of Doubles using the Stack class
    
    // 2. Use a loop to add 100 random doubles between 0 and 100 to the Stack
    
    // 3. Create a Queue of Doubles using the ArrayDeque class

    // 4. Pop off 5 elements from the Stack and add them to the Queue 

    // 5. Print and remove a random number of elements, from 1 to 5 elements,
    //    from the front of the Queue. Example:
    //    "removing 3 elements from Queue: 25 57 2"
    
    // 6. Pop off as many elements from the stack to fill the Queue with 5
    //    elements. If there aren't enough elements in the Stack to fill the 
    //    queue, fill the queue as much as possible. 
    
    // 7. Loop until there are no more elements in the Stack and Queue and all
    //    the elements are printed

    
    /* Example:
     * stack: { ..., 60, 36, 88, 4, 65, 75, 10 }
     * queue: { } // empty

     * Pop off 5 elements from stack to fill queue with 5 elements
     * stack: { ..., 60, 36 }
     * queue: { 10, 75, 65, 4, 88 }
     * 
     * Remove a random number of elements from the front of the queue
     * (2 in this example) and print the number of elements being removed
     * and the elements
     * stack: { ..., 60, 36 }
     * queue: { 65, 4, 88 }
     * "Removing 2 elements: 10 75"
     * 
     * Pop off 2 elements from the stack to fill the queue to 5
     * stack: { ... }
     * queue: { 65, 4, 88, 36, 60 }
     * 
     * Repeat until there are no more elements in the stack and queue
