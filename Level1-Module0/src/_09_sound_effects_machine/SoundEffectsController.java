	// 4.  If you successfully made this a MouseListener, there should now be a mouseClicked method. 
	//     Add code to this method for each of the buttons / sounds in the Sound Effects Machine.
	//     Hint: use the button's text to figure out which one was clicked
	
	
	
	// 5.  Call a method on the Model to get the sound (AudioClip) that goes with the button, 
	//     then play it.
	
	
 	// 6.  Go back to the View (SoundEffects class) and add this MouseListener to all of the buttons.
